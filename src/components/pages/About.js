    <h3>Development Background</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to take a moment and share a little bit about my journey to becoming a full stack web developer. 

      My journey to development started back in the myspace days where I experimented with html styling on my personal page. Later I spent 4 months traveling the country with my spouse. While we were on our trip I invested in some self taught coding courses to further my knowledge. Two kids and a few years later the desire to gain a better understanding of web development led me to a coding boot camp through the University of Arizona.
